# Android-Dialer-Application

Custom Dialer Application in Android.

The App user types a number or name in the interface. 

Now the app will look for a phone number embedded in the text typed by the user.

If a phone number conforming to a phone number format is found, the
app opens a dialer window with that phone number showing in the
corresponding window. The user may or may not decide to dial the number.
